Over the past few years, CEMIG has faced a growing challenge related to the management of its vast electrical infrastructure. With thousands of kilometers of distribution networks spread throughout the state and a significant amount of critical equipment operating in the field, the company has been dealing with recurring operational failures. In many cases, these failures are not detected in advance, resulting in frequent power outages and directly impacting customer satisfaction and the company's financial efficiency.

This situation is further exacerbated when we consider the average time to restore service after these outages. In dense urban areas, the response is usually faster, but in remote areas—especially rural or hard-to-reach areas—response times can be significantly longer. In fact, operational data reveals that approximately 70% of incidents require more than four hours to be resolved, which poses a considerable risk to service continuity and the company's institutional image.

Another critical issue identified in CEMIG's service channels concerns the customer experience. Many users report difficulties seeking support, and approximately 40% of calls received by agents are repeats of previous requests. This highlights not only a lack of personalized and agile service, but also puts pressure on the support team, resulting in an average handling time (AWT) exceeding 8 minutes, which is far from ideal for companies in the sector.

Finally, the company recognizes that the pursuit of greater operational efficiency and sustainability has become a strategic priority. With increasing demand variability, the rise of renewable energy sources, and the challenges related to detecting consumer fraud, it is essential that CEMIG advance the digitalization of its processes. Real-time data integration, predictive modeling, and analytical intelligence are now key to ensuring a more intelligent, responsive, and sustainable operation.
